## Summary

This package provides model selection in the Web GUI: the `/model` popup command and the composer's model seat, both over one per-session directory of provider-grouped models. Choosing a model submits the complete selection — provider, model, and reasoning effort — which the Host snapshots at the next prompt-assembly boundary, so the following request uses it while a running step keeps its assembled selection. The composer seat shows a two-level Model/Effort menu: models stay provider-grouped, and the selected exact model supplies its adapter-owned effort names and default. When the Host reports that no adapter serves the session's route, the composer input goes inert until a route becomes available.

The composer seat is `session-maybe`. A New Session browser draft loads the Host-scoped catalog through Session Controller's `session.modelCatalog`, stages its complete selection in browser memory, and makes no session-selection RPC. First-send preparation applies that selection to the newly materialized ordinary Session after earlier preparation such as Agent Preset composition and before the captured prompt is released. Starting another draft or reconnecting clears the staged selection and catalog.

The Host-reported provider/model/reasoning `ModelSelection` is the single selection fact, but it is echoed only when the exact provider/model pair remains in the advertised groups; an absent catalog row leaves the routable selection intact while the trigger prompts `Select model`, no stale row is synthesized, and no Effort row is shown until the user picks an advertised model. Directory loads and selections share a generation counter so an older response never overwrites a newer one; a connection reset drops every resident projection and repulls the Host-restored selection before display. Provider-local metadata failures list inline while usable groups stay selectable, and selection failures retain the prior selection and directory.

Real directories are per-session, resolved lazily through `ctx.modelDirectories.directoryFor(sessionId)`, and disposed with the session scope; the draft uses one root-owned `DraftModelDirectory`. Addressed subagent sessions expose neither real-session entry, and their directory rejects loads, selections, and reconnect refreshes, because ordinary Agent-bound model RPCs would activate persisted child history outside the direct-parent continuation path.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside `ui-conversation` and the commands package; the composer then shows the model seat next to the pending indicator, and `/model` opens the same directory as a popup. Both surfaces show the host-reported current selection when the exact provider/model pair remains in the advertised groups; a missing catalog row leaves the routable selection intact while the trigger prompts `Select model`.

### Model and effort

Models stay grouped by provider. The menu shows model and effort names only; catalog descriptions remain available to other consumers. The `/model` popup applies the selected model's default effort; the composer can then choose any advertised effort. An adapter without reasoning metadata leaves the Effort row absent; there is no arbitrary effort input.

### Unroutable sessions

When the Host reports that no adapter serves the session's route, this plugin raises a composer block and the input goes inert with its own copy; recovering clears it without a reload. A `null` before the first load or after one failed never blocks, and catalog membership never blocks either — a route serving a model it does not advertise is missing from the groups yet usable.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

Two entries over ONE per-session directory owned by `ModelDirectoryResolver` (`ctx.modelDirectories`): the `/model` popupSelect contribution (registered through `ctx.commandUi`) and the composer's named `conversation.input.model` seat both load the session's advisory directory through `session.models` and submit through `session.selectModel` via the same `ModelDirectory` instance, so a switch made in either entry is what the other shows next. Directory loads and selections share a generation counter so an older response never overwrites a newer one; a connection reset drops every resident projection and repulls the Host-restored selection. Directories are per-session, resolved lazily, and disposed with the session scope; addressed subagent sessions expose neither entry. Every resident directory refetches directly on forwarded `llm/adapters-updated` and `settings/document-updated` owner events.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the model surface is not enough. They move from the browser surfaces to the command popup shell and the selection contract.

- [ui-commands](../ui-commands/README.md) — the popupSelect shell the `/model` contribution registers into.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the composer's `conversation.input.model` seat and the composer block.
- [dsh-agent-default-model](../../core/agent-default-model/README.md) — the default-model service for sessions that never choose.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the `session.selectModel` RPC available to ordinary sessions, both entries submit the complete `ModelSelection` that the Host snapshots at the next prompt-assembly boundary, so the following request uses the selected provider, model, and effort while a running step keeps its assembled selection. Draft menu interaction remains browser-local; after materialization, the selection becomes durable only when the first request header records the request that consumes it. Menu interaction adds no prompt content.

#### KV Cache effect

Switching the route can reduce or invalidate provider-side cache reuse for subsequent requests; the prompt prefix itself is untouched.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current model surface. They are current package constraints, not a general model-router comparison or a task backlog.

- **No addressed-subagent selection** — draft selection materializes only into a new ordinary Session; subagent continuation deliberately exposes no independent model-selection contract.
- **Directory names are presentation-only** — selection and persistence use provider/model/effort ids; a provider whose catalog or exact-model metadata lookup fails lists as an unselectable failure row until reload.
- **No arbitrary effort input** — the composer offers only the exact model's adapter-advertised levels; an adapter without reasoning metadata leaves the Effort row absent.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. A single command contribution registration whose disposal is proven by the HMR-safety spec — it emits no cordis events and owns no cross-plugin mutable state.
